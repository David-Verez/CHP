## Documentation

Detailed documentation for this project is located in the /docs folder

## Overview

This software package imports the annual electrical demand and thermal demand data for a simulated mid-rise apartment 
building. Using this data, the software calculates the electrical and thermal load dispatch of a micro-combined heat and 
power (mCHP) system paired with an auxiliary boiler and thermal energy storage system (TES). 

The mCHP system has two dispatch options: operate so that the electricity produced by the system matches the electrical 
demand of the building (electric load following), or operate so that the thermal energy produced by the system matches 
the buildingâ€™s thermal demands (thermal load following). This software package calculates the operating costs of both 
and chooses the operating schedule that is most favorable.
